# How to install

After downloading the program "kp.exe", save it somewhere safe, as we will use it as an ambient variable. 

Press `win`, write `ambient variables`, probably a program named "Edit Ambient Variables" will show up, press `Enter`.

Go to "Ambient Variables", double click "Path" tab >> "New" >> "Search" and go to the folder that kp is in.

After that, press "Ok" like crazy, and you're done. Open a new cmd or powershell and write `kp -h`. If something shows up, it worked.

NOT UPDATED WITH UBUNTU.
